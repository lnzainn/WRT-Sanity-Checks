# WRT-Sanity-Checks

This repository contains code that will do the following:
- Detect excess MBLD scrambles
- Detect cases where there are lack of MBLD scrambles
- Detect cases where there are potentially excess scramble sets in events other than MBLD (pending)
- Look for anomalies in results including but not limited to suspicious fast single, worst single that is way off etc. (pending)
